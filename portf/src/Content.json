        "challengeOverview": "Inspire Music Academy is a music school based in Markham, Ontario that provides music lessons based around the RCM curriculum to youth. With non-essential services closing down during the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, finding new students and retaining current ones became a struggle.",
        "solutionOverview": "To better engage a wider audience, especially one now more habituated to the internet than ever before, I designed a new website from ground up to introduce consistency and cohesiveness.", 
        "tools": "ReactJS, Figma",
        "duration": "3 weeks",

        "problem": "The many pain points of the existing website accumulated to create lack of perceived credibility and frustration finding information, thus failing to sell the academy's packages.\nHow might we help potential students and/or their guardians determine if Inspire Music Academy is a good fit and, if so, book the appropriate lessons?",
        "problemFigures": ["inspiremusic-problem-fig1", "inspiremusic-problem-fig2", "inspiremusic-problem-fig3"],
        "goals": "The core of the website was to reflect the school’s unique selling points to distinguish them from competitive, prestige-focused music schools in the same region, coming down to three basic pillars: humble simplicity, a well-rounded nature, and a community-based atmosphere. I prioritized the following key, tangible objectives:",

        "visualIdentity": "The colour palette for the website was taken directly from the school's branding colours, with additional hues for more visual variation where contrast was needed. Clean, sans-serif fonts were used to maintain legibility and simplicity.",

        "development": "The site was developed using ReactJS over approximately two weeks. Seeing as this was my first React website, the process was one of trial and error, of triumph and frustration. During this stage, I took advantage of the utility of reusable components and learned to integrate APIs into web apps. After a handful of 2AM coding sessions, the website—with mobile responsiveness—was complete.",
