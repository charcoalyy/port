        "challengeOverview": "Inspire Music Academy is a music school based in Markham, Ontario that provides music lessons based around the RCM curriculum to youth. With non-essential services closing down during the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, finding new students and retaining current ones became a struggle.",
        "solutionOverview": "To better engage a wider audience, especially one now more habituated to the internet than ever before, I designed a new website from ground up to introduce consistency and cohesiveness.", 
        "tools": "ReactJS, Figma",
        "duration": "3 weeks",

        "problem": "The website's pain points led to a lack of perceived credibility and frustration finding information for the user, failing to sell the academy's packages.\nHow might we help potential students and/or their guardians determine if Inspire Music Academy is a good fit and, if so, book the appropriate lessons?",
        "goals": "The core of the website was to reflect the school’s unique selling points to distinguish them from competitive, prestige-focused music schools in the same region, coming down to three basic pillars: \nHumble simplicity;\nWell-rounded nature;\nCommunity-based atmosphere",
        "solution": "The new website included:\nA booking system that integrated Google Calendar\nUI elements consistented across all pages\nUpdated information architecture that complemented the navigation experience\nFront-end built on ReactJS taking advantage of reusable components",

        "solutionOverview": "As part of Hack the North 2022, we built a web application that would allocate seats to remove the need for physical waiting lines, as well as provide data for how many buses would be needed.",

        "problem": "How might we help students make their GO Bus commutes without the long waiting lines and lack of time accuracy?",
        "goals": "",
        "solution": "A web application was most accessible, as it does not require download and can be used from a variety of browsers\nThe web application includes:\nA flexible, simple interface that lets riders pick departure or arrival times from available buses, secure a definitive spot, and pay, as well as cancel or edit if needed, preventing overcapacity for each bus\nNofications that alert users when they need to get to the bus stop\nA data-tracking system that will serve to inform future bus shifts based on expected passengers at given time intervals",
